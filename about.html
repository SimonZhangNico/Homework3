        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>I have a deep passion for music, especially music production and saxophone playing. Music production fascinates me because it allows me to combine creativity with technology to create something truly unique. I love exploring different sounds and experimenting with various production tools to create original compositions or re-imagine existing ones. The saxophone is my main instrument and I have been playing it for several years. I appreciate the deep and expressive elements it adds to my musical creations, and performing with it brings me great joy.</p>
        <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>In addition to music, basketball is another great interest of mine. Not only is it a sport, but it is also a way to stay active and develop a competitive spirit. Playing basketball helps develop my leadership and teamwork skills, as well as discipline and perseverance on and off the court. For similar reasons, I also enjoy playing soccer. These activities keep me fit and healthy, but also give me a break from the stress of school.</p>
        <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>In short, my interest in music and sports allows me to balance intellectual pursuits with creativity and physical activity, helping me maintain a well-rounded lifestyle.</p>
