        <h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>
        <p id='main'>My name is Hangjun Zhang and I am from Chengdu, China. I am currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University, majoring in Data Science and Economics. In the academic field, I am very interested in business analytics, fintech, and data-driven areas, and have had internships and research experiences. These experiences have fostered my interest in applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p id='main'>Outside of school, I am passionate about playing basketball and soccer, which helps me stay active and develop teamwork skills. In addition, I have been playing the saxophone as well as studying music production for several years now, and I find music to be a creative outlet to balance my analytical work. I love exploring the crossover between different disciplines, whether it's through my love of sports or my musical pursuits.</p>
        <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p id='main'>As a data analyst with a passion for creative work, I am eager to explore new horizons and interact with different people and cultures. Whether it's through music production, sports, or traveling, I believe life is full of exciting opportunities to grow and learn. If you would like to learn more about me or my work as a data analyst, please feel free to contact me!</p>
